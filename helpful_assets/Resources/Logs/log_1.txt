Jay: Aw man, why did I have to draw the short stick?

Perkins: Because the "will of the Cosmic Field" deemed it so.

Jay: Oh ha ha, very funny. I open up about my beliefs one time and all of a sudden it's my one and only character trait, very nice. can it go back to when I was called "flapjack?"

Perkins: Oh Yeah, Flapjack! still can't believe you ate all that candy in one sitting, truly the peak of human determination. 

Jay: Oh please, you're makin' me blush.

Perkins: Oh, wait a second, I'm not getting your video feed, did you forget to charge your body cam?

Jay: You just now realized? I don't know what's going on with it but Pete's been lookin’ into it. I can give you the audiobook version if you want

Perkins: No, that's alright, I've been looking at Simms feed.

Jay: Well too bad! As I, Scavenger One's bravest scout "Samuel Jay Hoffborne" enter the dreaded ruins of Enceladus, slipping on what seems to be broken floor tile, I spot... NOTHING. this place is as dead as my hamster, Frodo, may he rest in the Mines of Moria, eternally.

Perkins: Okay first off, "bravest scout?" wow. second, Frodo didn't even die in the Mines of Moria!

Jay: [i]My[/i] Frodo did.

Perkins: I don't think calling his hamster wheel "the Mines of Moria" counts.

Jay: What are you, a pet death expert? I thought you didn't even have one

Perkins: No, you're right, sometimes though I'd sneak a stray cat in every once in a while. but my parents would always find it and ground me. Eventually I grew up... I realized that a petless life is one with less hassle anyway, no pee stains on my carpet that’s for sure.

Jay: Man, that's just kinda sad.

Perkins: Not having to clean up pee stains isn't sad, okay?

Jay: Whatever you say-

Jay: AHHH!
