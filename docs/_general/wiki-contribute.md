# Contributing to the Wiki
While contribution are helpful and accepted, they are not a requirement and you should not feel like you have to contribute. However, if you want to contribute to the wiki then you can follow the guide below.

***
### Forking the Github Repository.
Due to the nature of Github and the way not collaborators have to to submit Pull-Requests, you will need to for the main [Modding Github Repo](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding). This will allow you to make local changes to the wiki and use them in a Pull-Request.
### Making your Changes
Now you can clone your forked repository to your computer. Once you have done so, you can open the `docs/` directory and make edits to the `.md` files which is the content for the wiki. Make sure to update `_sidebar.md` for your pages to be shown.
### Creating a Pull Request
I will be showing how to open a Pull Request on [Github Modding Repo](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding), if you run into any issues please feel free to ask in Discord or open an Issue.

#### Click the `New pull request` button

#### Now Fill-out Pull Request Information
There is three things on this page that you need to do. The first is selecting your fork of the repository. (marked by yellow line on image)

The second thing to change if needed is the branch (main is fine if you didn't create a branch for the changes on your fork.) It is marked by the red line.

The last thing is clicking the `Create pull request` button. Its circled in green.

## Some Notes about Pull Request.
A pull request being created doesn't mean that the wiki will now show your information. For your changes to go live on the wiki page, Big Boy (Jesse) has to accept and merge the pull request into the official modding repository.
