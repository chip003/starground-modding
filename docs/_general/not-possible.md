# What is and is not possible with Modding?
Due to the nature of the Godot Engine many things are possible, and more than you would think. So let's cover what is not possible. Below is a list of things that are not possible.

-  Implementing Logic that utilizes an Engine Extension
-  Defining a Global/Autoload Script. (Trying to find workaround)
- Creating a mod with C#, C++, or Rust. (Only GDScript is supported.)

### Reporting not Possible Task within Modding.
You can report any issues at [Modding Github](https://github.com/chip003/starground-modding) if you find something that has a valid usage for modding and is not currently possible.
