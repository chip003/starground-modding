# What is and is not possible with Modding?
Due to the nature of Godot Engine, many things are possible and more then you think. So lets cover what is not possible, below is a list of things that is not possible.

-  Implementing Logic that utilizes an Engine Extension
-  Defining a Global/Autoload Script. (Trying to find workaround)
- Creating a mod with C#, C++, or Rust. (Only GDScript is supported.)
