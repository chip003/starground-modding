Installing mods is very simple, and requires little effort.

## Installing Your Mod
Mods will always be a .zip file distributed on Discord until Steam Workshop support is here.

After downloading your mod, drag it into your mods folder located at C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Godot\app_userdata\Starground\mods.

After your mod is in this folder, you can open the game and enable the mods that appear in the list. Then restart your game, and your mods are good to go!


## Risks
While some mod virus scanning is implemented into Starground, mods can still hide dangerous code that can harm you and your computer. Before installing any mods, be sure that it comes from a reputable source that you can trust.
