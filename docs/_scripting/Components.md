# Components

Components are an easy way to add specific functionality to your scenes without the hassle of inheriting tons of functions and variables from parent classes. These are all in the form of a scene that you can add as a child to your scenes (don't use the script!).

## save_component.tscn
This component is a very simple and easy way of saving your modded buildings to a game's save (files located in the saves/ folder with the .dat extension). This component will save a building's:
* Filepath
* Name
* Position
* Inventory (from inventory components)
* Custom variables (variables in the main scene's script)

To save a custom variable, add it to the Variables array in the inspector panel. This should be a string of the name of your variable.

If you don't need any special variables saved however, then it's as simple as throwing it into your scene, and your done!

## inventory_component.tscn
This component is a widely used component for handling everything related to inventories. If you're adding anything into the game that can hold items or open a UI, definitely use this component.

There's quite a few settings in the inspector. Most of them should be self-explanatory, and some of them should never be modified (for internal use only).
