# Welcome to The Starground Modding Wiki!
This is a wiki for a public Github repository where Starground modders can get mod templates, open issues to improve modding support, and read through this wiki for guides and instructions on how to mod things.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask away on Discord in the modding category, or send Big Boy (Jesse) a DM with your question.

Modders are encouraged to leave issues on this repository in order to improve modding support. This could be a feature suggestion for modding resources, or potential improvements to documentation.
